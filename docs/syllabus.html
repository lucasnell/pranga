<div id="absence-policy-and-expectations" class="section level2">
<h2>Absence Policy and Expectations</h2>
<p>It is the student’s professional responsibility to review the absence
policy and specific attendance requirements for all courses, clerkships
and curricular activities in which they are involved. Students should
avoid scheduling or participating in activities that directly conflict
with required sessions, courses, or clerkships.</p>
</div>
<div id="required-courses" class="section level2">
<h2>Required Courses</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Students are expected to be present at ALL required-attendance
sessions and final exams. It is the student’s responsibility to be aware
of the attendance expectations for each course. For students with
disabilities who have registered with OAE, work with the course
leadership (e.g., course director and course manager), at the beginning
of courses to receive accommodations.</p></li>
<li><p>If a student anticipates missing a required-attendance session,
they must communicate and receive approval from the course director at a
minimum of two-weeks in advance. In cases involving illness and
unexpected emergencies, students should notify their course director as
soon as possible submit a notification form (see below) thereafter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All students are required to complete the online notification
form regardless of whether the absence has been approved. If the student
and course director are unable to agree on the appropriateness of an
absence for a required session, they are encouraged to schedule a
meeting with the course director and their assigned Advising Dean to
discuss the absence further. In addition, the course may require the
student to complete an internal notification form.</p></li>
<li><p>Approval of all absences is at the discretion of the course
director.</p></li>
<li><p>If an absence is not approved it is expected that the student
will make the necessary arrangements to change their schedule to be
present.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Students are responsible for the content and work associated with
all missed sessions. Students are also expected to meet the
participation requirement and contribute to their group’s learning, even
for sessions missed, and must work out an equitable solution that
balances the individual student’s needs with the needs of the group.
Under no circumstances will an absence relieve a student of meeting all
of the academic requirements of the course. If the absence request
conflicts with a session or sessions that cannot be otherwise made up or
completed, the student is advised that the absence may affect their
performance evaluation in the course.</p></li>
<li><p>The following are considered professionalism issues that may
result in a referral to <strong>Committee on Performance,
Professionalism, and Promotion (CP3)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Absence from a required session without obtaining advance
approval. In cases of emergency, it is the student’s responsibility to
contact the course as soon as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Failure to communicate with the course director</p></li>
<li><p>Failure to complete the online absence notification</p></li>
<li><p>Trend in number of absences across courses</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that each student is responsible for requesting approval
for their own absence; no group approvals will be granted.</p>

<div id="end-quarter-period-and-policy-statement"
class="section level2">
<h2>End Quarter Period and Policy Statement</h2>
<p>The End Quarter Period and the administration of exams have been
significantly impacted by COVID. If you have questions about specific
exam policies and procedures, please consult your course Canvas page,
your course syllabus, or reach out to your Course Director.</p>
<p>The End Quarter Policy Statement</p>
<p>The End-Quarter Period is a time of reduced social and
extracurricular activity preceding final examinations. Its purpose is to
permit students to concentrate on academic work and to prepare for final
examinations.</p>
<p>During the <strong>End-Quarter Period, classes are regularly
scheduled and assignments made</strong>; this regular class time is used
by instructors in whatever way seems best suited to the completion and
summation of course material. Instructors should neither make
extraordinary assignments nor announce additional course meetings in
order to “catch up” on course presentations that have fallen behind.
They are free, however, and even encouraged to conduct review sessions
and to suggest other activities that might seem appropriate for students
preparing for final examinations.</p>
<p>Students are expected to <strong>remain on campus</strong> during the
<strong>end-quarter period</strong> and are advised to avoid planning
activities that might conflict with course commitments and final exam
preparation during this week.</p>
<p>No final examinations should be given during the End-Quarter Period
except:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In classes where graded homework assignments or quizzes are routine
parts of the instruction process.</li>
<li>In classes with laboratories where the final examination will not
test the laboratory component. In such a case, the laboratory session(s)
during the End- Quarter Period may be used to examine students on that
aspect of the course.</li>
<li>In Practice of Medicine, in which previously scheduled standardized
patient (SP) assessments are permitted during the End-Quarter
Period.</li>
<li>In Science of Medicine, in which assessments may be maximally spread
out in order to account for student wellness.</li>
</ol>
<p>Major papers or projects about which the student has had reasonable
notice may be called due in the End-Quarter Period. Take-home final
examinations, given in place of the officially scheduled in-class
examination, may be distributed in the End-Quarter Period. Although the
instructor may ask students to return take-home examinations early in
the final examination period, the instructor may not call them due until
the end of the regularly scheduled examination time for that course.
Such a policy respects the principle that students’ final examinations
are to be scheduled over a period of several days.</p>
<p>Please note: In the COVID-era, there may be marked changes to the
above policies. Our procedures will need to adapt to the changing
landscape of county, state, and university regulations.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-examinations-courses" class="section level2">
<h2>Final Examinations: Courses</h2>
<p>Final examinations are scheduled by the Office of Medical Education,
which posts tentative dates and times by the end of the previous quarter
and final schedules by the end of the second week of the quarter.
Students anticipating conflicts in examination schedules should seek to
resolve them with course instructors.</p>
<p>Students are expected to remain on campus during the final exam
period and should not book travel or other plans until they have
confirmed the dates that they must sit for their final exams. Final
exams should take priority over other commitments and students are
advised to plan accordingly.</p>
<p>Final examinations are governed by the regulations below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Students are expected to take the final examination unless at
least 24 hours prior to the examination they have received formal
written approval for either dropping the course from the course director
or for obtaining an incomplete from an Advising Dean. Incompletes are
given for significant personal or medical reasons beyond the student’s
control. If a student does not appear for the examination and has not
been granted a drop or an incomplete, the student will receive a
fail.</p></li>
<li><p>Students are expected to report for their examinations at the
time and place designated by the Office of Medical Education or the
course director, unless the course director has made alternative
arrangements. While examinations are not “proctored” as such, students
must take the examination in the designated location within the
prescribed examination time. Students are expected to adhere to the
Honor Code at all times during examinations.</p></li>
<li><p>When the final examination or its appropriate substitute is not
an in-class examination (e.g., when an instructor assigns a take-home
examination, paper, or project in lieu of an in-class examination), the
schedule and format of the final examination, or its substitute, will be
determined no later than the end of the second week of the quarter and,
if changed subsequently, may be only a modification approved by a
majority of the students in the class.</p></li>
<li><p>Students with documented disabilities who have registered with
and been determined by the Office of Accessible Education (OAE) to
require special examination accommodations are responsible for notifying
both the School of Medicine Learning Strategies Education Specialist and
their course directors at the beginning of the quarter or when their
accommodation letter is given that they will need accommodations. Unless
students receive accommodations mid- quarter, they must let the School
of Medicine Learning Strategies Education Specialist and their course
directors know of their accommodations needs no later than the end of
the second week of the quarter for which they are receiving
accommodations. Reminder: students needing exam accommodations are to
contact the OAE first, prior to notifying their course
director(s).</p></li>
<li><p>Feedback on written examinations is to be as complete as
practicable. Please note: In the COVID-era, there may be marked changes
to the above policies. Our procedures will need to adapt to the changing
landscape of county, state, and university regulations.</p></li>

<h2>Exam Policy for Required MD Pre-Clerkship Courses</h2>
<p>Per the Stanford University Honor Code faculty can determine the best
exam environment for their tests and make any requirements they see fit
with regard to how students take the exam.</p>
<p>To uphold the spirit of the University’s Honor Code and to create
consistency across courses in the pre-clerkship curriculum, the Office
of Medical Education provides the following guidelines for closed-book
examination environments in our required MD courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students will complete exams in the rooms assigned by the
course.</li>
<li>Exams are non-collaborative and, unless otherwise noted by course
faculty, closed book.</li>
<li>Unless otherwise stipulated by the course director, use of any
electronic device to access other resources, including (but not limited
to) the internet, your notes, and your colleagues, is expressly
forbidden and constitutes a violation of the Stanford Honor Code.</li>
<li>The use of personal listening devices is expressly forbidden in the
exam setting.</li>
<li>Students with disabilities or other special needs for which they may
need accommodations should notify the Dean of the Office of Medical
Student Affairs and the Office of Accessible Education well in advance
to receive appropriate accommodation for exams. Once students receive an
official accommodations letter, they must let the School of Medicine
Education Specialist and their course directors know of their
accommodations request no later than the end of the second week of the
quarter every quarter in which they are requesting accommodations.</li>

<h2>Evaluation of Performance in Courses</h2>

<p>All pre-clerkship MD program courses are graded on a pass/fail basis.
It is the prerogative of each course director to determine the best
method for assessing student performance for their course. Learning
activities such as quizzes, short papers, laboratory exercises, problem
sets, presentations, and group discussions, may be offered on a graded
or ungraded basis at the discretion of the course director.</p>
<p>Attendance and participation may be required for some sessions,
e.g. where small group interaction is essential to mastery of material
in the course. Course directors are expected to announce criteria for
passing a course by the end of the second week of the quarter.</p>
<div id="grading-system" class="section level3">
<h3>Grading System</h3>
<p>The following grading system is used to report on the official
transcript the performance of students in all courses and clerkships
taken while an MD degree candidate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pass (+)</strong> indicates that a student has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the responsible department or teaching group that
they have mastered the material taught in the course.</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete (I)</strong> indicates that extenuating medical
or personal circumstances beyond the student’s control have prevented
completion of course requirements. An incomplete can be corrected in a
manner specified by the department or teaching group and must be
corrected within one year (unless the Committee on Performance,
Professionalism and Promotion specifies an earlier date). When a student
takes a final or makeup examination following an incomplete, it becomes
a pass, marginal pass or fail. If the student does not attempt to
correct the incomplete within the agreed-upon time, it becomes a
fail.</li>
<li><strong>Continuing (N)</strong> indicates that the course has not
concluded and that the student is continuing the course or that a minor
component of a course (as defined by the course director) is
pending.</li>
<li><strong>Grade Not Reported (GNR)</strong> indicates that a grade has
not been reported by the instructor.</li>
</ul>
<p>A student may not receive credit for repeating a course unless the
content has changed significantly, as determined by the course
director.</p>
<p>In addition to these transcript-related grades, additional
designations are used internal to the School of Medicine to report on
academic progress:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marginal Pass (MP)</strong> indicates that a student has
fallen short of meeting minimal performance standards for a pass but has
done better than a fail at the end of the academic quarter, and that
additional work or remediation is necessary to achieve a pass. MP grades
are tracked internally in the School of Medicine through the Medical
Education Platform (MEP), and should be entered as an N grade in
Axess.</li>
<li><strong>Fail (-)</strong> indicates that a student has not met the
minimum performance standards for the course. A course in which a
student has received a fail grade does not show up on the official
transcript. A course in which a student has received a fail grade must
be repeated, and the student must achieve a passing grade within one
year of the failure or prior to beginning clerkships, whichever is
sooner.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="mid-quarter-feedback-for-pre-clerkship-courses"
class="section level3">
<h3>Mid-Quarter Feedback for Pre-Clerkship Courses</h3>
<p>All required pre-clerkship courses must provide students formal
mid-quarter feedback of performance. Mid-quarter feedback must be
provided early enough to allow a student the opportunity to improve
their performance before the end of the course. Mid-quarter feedback
should be provided by the mid-point of the course, and by the end of the
5th week for standard 10-week courses. Mid-quarter feedback is recorded
in the Medical Education Platform (MEP) student record system.</p>
</div>
<div id="narrative-assessment-in-pre-clerkship-curriculum"
class="section level3">
<h3>Narrative Assessment in Pre-Clerkship Curriculum</h3>
<p>Narrative assessment is provided to medical students in courses where
the primary mode of instruction includes small group activities
(typically up to 12 students per group), small clinical reasoning,
clinical skills, and/or team-based learning where attendance is required
and there is longitudinal direct contact with an individual faculty
member for at least 10 hours during the course.</p>
<p>In other pre-clerkship courses, where the primary mode of instruction
takes place in lectures with occasional small group activities narrative
assessments may be provided at the end of the course if attendance for
the sessions is required and individual faculty have had at least 10
hours of direct contact time with the student during the course.</p>
<p>In addition, faculty may provide narrative comments if they so choose
when submitting mid-quarter feedback for each student via MEP (Medical
Education Platform).</p>

<div id="disability-accommodations" class="section level3">
<h3>Disability Accommodations</h3>
<p>Information about Disability Accommodations can be found at:</p>

<p>As outlined on the Office of Accessible Education (OAE), Stanford
University has an institutional commitment to providing equal
educational opportunities for qualified students with disabilities in
accordance with state and federal laws and regulations, including the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and 2008, and Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973. To provide equality of access for students
with disabilities, accommodations (including auxiliary aids and
services) will be provided to the extent necessary to comply with state
and federal laws. For each student, these accommodations will
specifically address those functional limitations of the disability
which adversely affect equal education opportunity.</p>
<p>Medical students who may need an academic accommodation based on the
impact of a disability must initiate the request with the OAE.
Professional staff within OAE will evaluate the request with required
documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an
Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which
the request is being made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as
possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The
Associate Dean of Medical Student Affairs serves as the liaison with the
OAE and is available to assist in the facilitation of accommodations.
coordinates with the Office of Accessible Education to facilitate
accommodations.</p>
<p>Student Responsibilities</p>
<p>Each student bears the responsibility of initiating a
disability-related request for accommodations with the OAE prior to the
time such an accommodation is needed. In addition, and more
specifically, it is the responsibility of the student to:</p>
<ul>
<li>As early as possible, register with the OAE and submit documentation
of disability as a prerequisite to receiving accommodations.</li>
<li>Notify the OAE immediately when an accommodation is not being
provided correctly.</li>
<li>Notify the OAE immediately when discontinuing an accommodation
(e.g., notetaking) or dropping a course for which alternate format
materials are required.</li>
<li>Provide timely notification to faculty of approved accommodations by
submitting the OAE Accommodation Letter.</li>
<li>Provide for personal disability-related needs or services such as
“personal care attendants,” transportation off campus, housekeeping,
golf cart rental, wheelchair repair, etc.</li>
<li>Meet the same standards—academic, technical, performance and
behavior— expected of all Stanford students.</li>
</ul>
<p>Faculty Responsibilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Notify students that accommodations are available.</li>
<li>Refer Students with Questions about Accommodations to the OAE</li>
<li>Do not seek to arrange accommodations by yourself with the
student.</li>
<li>Protect Student Privacy and Confidentiality</li>
<li>Maintain student confidentiality and treat all disability-related
information as confidential.</li>
<li>Although faculty do not have the right to ask about the nature of
the disability, if students choose to disclose their disability, this
information should be treated confidentially.</li>
<li>Refrain from identifying the student with a disability in class or
openly discussing accommodations or disability issues in front of
others.</li>
<li>Meet privately with a student when presented with and reviewing the
Accommodation Letter.</li>
<li>Collaborate with Student and OAE Staff in Arranging and Providing
Accommodations</li>
<li>Consult with the OAE staff if the academic accommodation(s)
recommended appear to violate the goals or requirements of the course.
Recommended accommodations are open for negotiation.</li>
<li>Permit the Use of Approved Accommodations</li>
<li>Provide accommodations only to students who are registered with the
OAE and who have submitted an Accommodation Letter.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="process-for-accommodations" class="section level3">
<h3>Process for Accommodations</h3>
<p>Students who need accommodations must first register with OAE. OAE
then sends an accommodations letter to Dr. Mijiza Sanchez Guzman,
Associate Dean in the Office of Medical Student Affairs, for official
record keeping. We cannot support accommodations from students who are
not registered with OAE.</p>
<p>Students are then responsible for letting instructors know that they
will need accommodations at the beginning of the quarter, or as soon as
possible if accommodations are given mid-quarter. It is up to the
student to advocate for him/herself in a timely manner. The instructor
may choose to deny accommodations if they feel the accommodations will
interfere with the essential elements of what the course is trying to
teach or what is being assessed.</p>
