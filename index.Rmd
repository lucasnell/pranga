This repo and website is named for *Parambassis ranga* â€” a transparent fish 
with a high reproductive rate.

We thought *P. ranga* would be a great mascot because the course we're teaching
is aimed at helping students improve their scientific reproducibility 
and transparency.

For course details, check out the [`Syllabus`](syllabus.html), and 
as our presentations are generated for class, we'll have them under the
`Lessons` tab above.
These presentations are for reference after each class and won't necessarily
be finalized until the associated class starts.
Note also that class presentations don't always behave when viewed on 
mobile devices.
